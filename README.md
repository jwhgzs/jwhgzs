Please allow me to brag about myself...

My English name is Jason Tan, and my Chinese name is 谭镇洋 (Zhenyang, Tan), a 14-year-old boy. I'm a middle school student from China. I'm a boarder so that I can only program at weekends (exclude some special cases like holidays or the COVID-19).

I started my main project [Vior](https://github.com/jwhgzs/vior) just because I saw a middle school team called [Bug-Duck](https://github.com/Bug-Duck), they made a JS framework [TNT.js](https://github.com/Bug-Duck/tntjs) like Vue, and bragged about it. My will motivated me to make one on my own. And I searched some data about Vue, learned some core principle of it, then I made it without help, and it actually becomes a mini Vue now!

What? Are you surprise with my English? LOL. I try my best to write in English by myself, and I'll use the translator in some special cases. Maybe programming makes my a lot stronger vocabulary and express ability than most middle school students. But I may make some funny language mistakes sometime, so your advice is most welcome!
